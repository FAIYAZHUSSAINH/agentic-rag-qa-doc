"""
Tests for the API-layer concerns added in Phase 2: API key auth, rate
limiting, and the /health/ endpoint.

Deliberately a SEPARATE file from test.py: test.py checks RAG *correctness*
(is the answer right?) and needs a populated DB plus a live Ollama - it's
slow and can only run where Ollama is installed. This file checks the HTTP
*contract* (auth/limits/shape) using FastAPI's TestClient, with the vector
DB and the LLM replaced by fakes. That makes it fast (milliseconds, not
minutes) and runnable in plain CI with no GPU/Ollama - a normal split
between "does the ML pipeline give good answers" and "does the API behave."
